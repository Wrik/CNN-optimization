# CNN-optimization
This repository contains the trained CNN models for lift coefficient (CL) and induced drag coefficient (CD_i) and the Matlab CNN code to develop such models.
The test data sets have been provided. They can be used to check the network training and also reproduce test results.
The complete input-output training and validatdation data sets are too large to be shared on GitHub and can be shared privately upon reasonable request.
The resuls obtained on applying such CNN models for non-intrusive gradient-based shape optimization suing Matlab's SQP algorithm is available at:
"https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06210".
