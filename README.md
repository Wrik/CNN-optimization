# CNN-optimization
This repository contains the trained CNN models for lift coefficient (CL) and induced drag coefficient (CD_i) and the Matlab CNN code to develop such models.
The test data sets have been provided. They can used to check the network training and also reproduce test results.
The complete input data to train and validate the CNN models are too large to be shared on GitHub and will be shared with interested parties on reasonable request.
The resuls obtained on applying such CNN models for non-intrusive gradient-based shape optimization suing Matlab's SQP algorithm is available at:
